my dad was so organized he sure was okay
what's this hello Jenny
well first of all I want you to know
that that I love you that I've got
something I want to share with you
something that's important to me you
know I was pretty good at my job
but the thing that was really important
to me miss will things like attending
your first violin recital playing
twinkle twinkle little star
you were wonderful or things like
sitting on the front porch with wine
just talking we'll see about your kids
or do you remember getting together big
pile of leaves and you jump in on the
middle of and leaves to go fly on lower
I just want you to remember this really
important thing I love you my little
star give your family everything give
them your time from the Church of Jesus
Christ of latter-day saints
