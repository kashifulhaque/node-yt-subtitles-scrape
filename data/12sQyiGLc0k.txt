all know it's a problem but no one wants

uncomfortable no literally the elephant

Nissan has aired its new commercial
featuring Barry Sanders Baker Mayfield
Derrick Henry Bryce young Devonta Smith
calling Carolina Panthers quarterback
Baker Mayfield from the comfort of his
Nissan Pathfinder former professional
football player Barry Sanders asks the
younger man if they're still added back
at the Heisman house
Baker can only offer a disgruntled
affirmative as he watches Derrick Henry
Bryce young and Devonta Smith practicing
cheerleader formations outside his
window
Devonta got a tuba he tacks on Langley
when the brass instrument begins to
bleed through the call
Barry decides that they've got to do
something about the elephant in the room
too many Alabama players are in the
house
literally Baker agrees awkwardly
avoiding eye contact with the University
of Alabama mascot and elephant Big Al
the elephant is in the room
