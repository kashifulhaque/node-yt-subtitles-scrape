this year for father's day
dad does not want another necktie
he does not want a picture frame
he does not want any device made for
trimming nostril hair
he does not want anything that
underhandedly suggest he do more chores
he does not want anything made in art
class
he does not want anything ordered from
one of those catalogs you find tucked
into the seat in front of you on an
airplane
he does not want a book he is never
going to read
and he does not
want a gift certificate to a coffee shop
this year for father's day
give dad
the gift a fire
and lows all gas grills charcoal grills
and all other manner of grilling
accessory are on sale
not for you
for god
lose
grow up
