Walmart is trying out a new way to make
online grocery shopping more convenient
for its customers you can find an
automated kiosk at the Walmart
Supercenter @ Britain and Council Road
in oklahoma city where orders can be
retrieved by online shoppers who prefer
to use self-service to obtain their
groceries customers place and pay for
their orders online and those orders are
filled inside there is a minimum
purchase amount the kiosk customer then
simply pulls up to the building and
walks up to the interface station to
enter his or her pickup code the kiosk
retrieves the order delivering it to the
customer in a process that takes about a
minute or less
