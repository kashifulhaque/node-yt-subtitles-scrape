Wow 47 years of marriage how do you do
it I decided a long time ago that when
Walt and I had a disagreement I'd go off
and do a little knitting well what does
Walter do
oh he just put us around in the yard 47
years it's got to take a lot of time and
patience and attention to detail
constant work patience I just love that
woman music before you lose it from the
Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints
