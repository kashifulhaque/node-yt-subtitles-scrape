hold your breath
make a wish
count to three
come with me
and you'll be
in a world up your
imagination take a look
and you'll see
into your imagination
we'll begin
with a spin
traveling
in the world of my creation
what we'll see
will define
explanation
if you want to view paradise
simply look around and view it
anything you want to
do it
want to change the world
there's nothing to it
