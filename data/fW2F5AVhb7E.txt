hey Lana was that math assignment hello
hi honey what are you doing doing
homework with my friends just call to
say hi that's all hi dad that's so cool
hey coolness runs in our family
well I was thinking I need my allowance
a little early what a coincidence I need
someone to clean the garage for really
family oh I'll see you tonight dad isn't
it about right time
I love you too dad from the Church of
Jesus Christ of latter-day saints
