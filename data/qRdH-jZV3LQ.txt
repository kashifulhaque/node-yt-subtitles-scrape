[Music]
every Saturday my dad would take my
sister and me down to the cafe for
breakfast
joso mom could sleep in
how we talk about school teachers
boyfriend he's closed everything they
have never said much though he just
listened he said that way he always knew
everything about us
oh and after we were finished he'd
always let us pick out her favorite song
on the jukebox a hit you know I never
once remember him complaining about our
music
what will your children remember about
you give them everything give them your
time from the Church of Jesus Christ of
latter-day saints
