hey mom why don't we all go
rollerblading tonight oh my not tonight
honey mom spending time with me now and
having a better chance of being close to
me when I'm a teenager and become a
roller coaster of emotions how are you
going to deal with that if we're not
close
go get your play give your family
everything give them your time from the
Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints
