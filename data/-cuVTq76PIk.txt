aloha tony balonovich here people call
me the king of cold cuts
the sandwich business has been real good
to me
of course it's not that tough just take
some bargain bread
slap on a little not quite meat get
yourself a catchy jingle what do you got
boom sandwich pool but now i got this
jimmy's john
showing up on my turf telling me that
they got the sandwich
of all sandwiches this tryhard's fresh
baked their bread all day
i'm jimmy's john's and i have high
quality reasonably priced sandwiches
customizable for your busy modern life
do you think i'm gonna let some two
first name sandwich joint steal
my throat
you may got fresh tomatoes jimmy's johns
but i got loyalty
stevie you're dead to me this is war
sandwich war
