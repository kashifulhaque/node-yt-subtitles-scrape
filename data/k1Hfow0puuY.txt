the night I wore my Sunday best for
supper with her special guests I found
my chair fix my hair and sat the best I
could
[Music]
one through the window from the wood
[Music]
[Applause]
Anthony
my mother said sit down this has to end
I put my knife beside my plate and tried
my best to sit up straight but the
sheriff wrote it and toss me a bag of
ten need your help partner
i way to my mother who calmly said
that's enough
now off to bed so I went where I was
sitting and waited in the gloom but the
Queen moon where I'd been and snuck into
my room family isn't it about time I
love you very much come back to dinner
and you may have dessert with us but
your friends will have to stay the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day
Saints
