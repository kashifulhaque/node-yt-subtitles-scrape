for me clothing isn't about covering up
insecurities or feeling safe
it's about self-expression
it's letting the world know who I am
what I represent so it's not just about
how the fabric feels but how it makes me
feel
it's not just wearing the brand it's
being the brand
living the lifestyle that's why I choose
cuts clothing because I don't feel
limited I feel liberated in life you
either go big fall short we make the cut
you
