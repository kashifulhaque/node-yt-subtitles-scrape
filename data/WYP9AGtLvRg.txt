greatness
it's just something we made up
somehow we've come to believe that
greatness is a gift
reserved for a chosen few
for prodigies
for superstars
and the rest of us can only stand by
watching
you can forget that
greatness is not some rare dna strand
it's not some precious thing
greatness is no more unique to us than
breathing
we're all capable of it
all of us
some people are told they were born with
greatness
[Music]
some people tell themselves
[Applause]
if greatness doesn't come knocking at
your door
maybe you should go knock on its door
sometimes greatness is about overcoming
insurmountable adversity
sometimes it's just fun
greatness isn't always measured in
tenths of a point
it's a bit bigger than that
sometimes greatness is something you
plan
but most of the time
it's just something you try
it's easy to think greatness is only
something you see on tv
unless of course
greatness is watching tv
[Applause]
greatness is a scary thing
until
it isn't
if we think greatness is supposed to
look a certain way act a certain way and
play a certain way
we certainly need to rethink some things
[Applause]
is it speed or endurance
does it happen in two hours or four or
six
is it finishing strong or barely
finishing
yes
[Applause]
is greatness worth fighting for
what do you think
if we face our fears
it means we're pointed in the right
direction
even if that direction is upside down
it's not the biggest stadium in the
world
not the biggest players either
but the pursuit of greatness is kind of
big enough
isn't it
you don't need an official court
an official net
or official uniforms
to be officially great
[Music]
greatness speaks for itself
once it learns to talk
greatness needs a lot of things
but it doesn't need an audience
some measure greatness and precious
metals
like i am
greatness has not born
it's made
if you'd like to tell the guy with the
sword he's not great because he's not
famous
be my guest
[Music]
there are no grand celebrations here
no speeches no bright lights
but there are great athletes
[Music]
somehow we've come to believe that
greatness is reserved for the chosen few
for the superstar
[Music]
the truth is
greatness is for all of us
this is not about lowering expectations
it's about raising them for every last
one of us
[Music]
because greatness is not in one special
place
and it is not in one special person
[Music]
greatness
is wherever somebody is trying to find
it
