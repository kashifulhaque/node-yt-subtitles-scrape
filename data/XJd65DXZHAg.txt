the outlook wasn't brilliant for the
Mudville nine that day the score stood
four to two with but one inning more to
play that all 5,000 throats were called
upon the flat for Casey mighty Casey was
advancing to the pad close by the sturdy
batsman the ball unheeded sped
that's not my staff said Casey start war
the umpire said she signaled to the
pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
a case he's still ignored it on the
umpire said now something different let
me read bout in the poem
Casey thought of summer days and times
she'd spent it all the hours she spent
with mom and dad outside on the backyard
grass practicing together when she was
just a lass she relaxed and a confidence
well it grew and above the roar of the
crowd she heard her dad say
[Music]
now some women are laughing and children
having fun tonight
this joy in Mudville Marty Casey
[Music]
[Applause]
damn
time
from the Church of Jesus Christ of
latter-day saints
[Applause]
