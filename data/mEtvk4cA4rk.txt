because it's Saturday and that's the day
to death please go right because I
really let go well good question
because what's the time I just spend the
day chasing a little white ball around
the course why well usually it's because
I hit the ball into the rock or out of
bounds sometimes I wonder why I even
took up this game maybe I'll come back a
little
well for starters maybe I could spend a
few more Saturdays doing something with
you he did when
family isn't it about time from the
Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints
