great probably missed the first song why
can't you ever find a parking space when
you're in a hurry oh look that couples
leaving just what we need now Oh
gentlemen look the concerts half over
and we're sitting here waiting for Sir
Galahad
finally
[Music]
okay care to join me me lady
marriage sire that you're never too far
apart when you're still holding hands
from your neighbors the Church of Jesus
Christ of latter-day saints
