hi this is Jack founder of
jack-in-the-box is the color there mr.
box douglas Gompers from burger week
magazine oh hey Doug Doug's a respected
fast food critic I recently dined on
your sourdough Jack combo and perfection
the cheese the Jumbo patty the gold and
sourdough bread the french fries Bravo
well thank you however I found the
dessert a bit dry it doesn't come with
dessert the candy the white round candy
with the happy face was it wearing a
scarf yes I believe it was rosy cheeks
fuzzy earmuffs yes that's it
Douglas you ate a holiday ball we're
giving one away free to customers who
buy a sourdough Jack combo but they're
not for dessert
therefore antennas or a pencil right
well that's going to improve your score
dramatically excellent
