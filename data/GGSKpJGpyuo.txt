we're instigators
fire starters
boat rockers line crossers and rain
makers
we're always positive but never happy
we take our clients goals seriously but
ourselves
not so much
[Music]
we work hard and play nice
we're tech savvy brand savvy and
strategically solid
we're your clever calculating
co-conspirators
bent on getting you a bigger piece of
that market share pie we move our
clients dramatically forward by sheer
will and energy
by working harder
thinking smarter
transforming raw data into insights and
insights into vision
we keep our strategies tight and our
minds flexible we embrace creativity as
a lifestyle and hold our work to the
highest standard
we don't win awards we earn them
[Music]
we don't expect results
we deliver them
[Music]
leap is your unfair advantage
